## Read 02- The coders computer

### There are four important features to look for in a text editor...
- code completion
+ syntax highlighting
* a variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
+ Options to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them



### What do the following commands do?
- pwd
- ls
- cd
- mkdir
- touch

pwd stands for Print Working Directory which tells you what your current working directory is.
ls means list files, and it lists all files in the current directory except for hidden files.
cd stands for change directory and it moves you to another directory
mkdir stands for make directory and this command can create multiple directories at once
The touch command allows you to modify a timestamp and create new files 



### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?(Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
While using cd projects, cd will direct you to the specific file, projects.
Using mkdir new-project will create multiple directories, sepcifically a new project.
With touch new-project/newfile.md, this command line will take you to a new file you created. With the command cd, you will change the current working directory. ls projects/new-project will list all of the projects and get into a new project.
