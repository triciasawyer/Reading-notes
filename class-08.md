## Reading: 08- Operators and loops

This topic matters because as we work with Javascript, we will need to understand how to navigate through it and know what everything means. By understanding operators and loops, we can better use Javascript to create what we want.

**What is an expression in JavaScript?**
An expression is a unit of code that resolves to a value. Although, there are two types of expressions. Some have side effects like assigning values, while others purely evalute.
**Why would we use a loop in our code?**
We would use loop in our code because it would allow us to do something repeatedly, easily and quickly.
**When does a 'for' loop stop executing?**
When a specified condition evalutes to false
**How many times will a 'while' loop execute?**
It will iterate as long as n is less than 3.
