## Lab 04- Structure Web Pages with HTML

This topic matters because it is the basis of what we will eventually be learning and getting more into. So understanding what HTML is itself, and some of the main points within that, will overall help with understanding to write HTML when we get to that.

**What is HTML and why do we use it?**
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content using several elements for different uses

**What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**
The three main parts are opening and closing tags, the content, and the element.

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**
Attributes

**What is a semantic element?**
A semantic element is an element that clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. For example, some semantic elements are article, nav, aside, footer, and header.
